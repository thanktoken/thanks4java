/**
 * This {@link ThankCurrency currency} is called <em>Vote</em> and represents a voting {@link ThankToken token}. It has
 * a static {@link #getValue(ThankToken, Instant) amount value} that does not change over time. With this
 * {@link ThankToken token} you are permitted to vote for a particular decision like an election. In order to place your
 * vote you simply perform a transaction that transfers the token to the
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.security.api.key.asymmetric.SecurityPublicKey public key} of the voting decision as
 * {@link io.github.thanktoken.core.api.transaction.ThankTransaction#getRecipient() recipient}. For a vote the actual decision is
 * publicly announced together with all available options and their
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.security.api.key.asymmetric.SecurityPublicKey public keys} as well as the voting start and
 * deadline. Further, the voting tokens are created and distributed for all involved people. For anonymity the
 * assignment of tokens to people is done with random and additional exchange is possible to avoid traceability from
 * voting {@link ThankToken tokens} to people. When the voting deadline is reached all the votes can be counted as they
 * are all public and anyone can verify that his particular vote has been included correctly. However, nobody can trace
 * down a voting {@link ThankToken token} except his own. All voting {@link ThankToken tokens} transferred after the
 * voting deadline are considered invalid and will be ignored. The same applies for voting {@link ThankToken tokens}
 * with a {@link ThankHeader#getTimestamp() timestamp} that differs from the voting start day (time is ignored).
